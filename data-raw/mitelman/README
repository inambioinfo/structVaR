Hs_GeneData.dat
Mm_GeneData.dat

   The data in the Gene Data files represents the information found
   on the CGAP Gene Info page.  Each gene section begins with the
   >> character delimiter followed by the UniGene Cluster ID. Subsequent lines
   in the section indicate particular features of the gene, each beginning
   with a descriptive qualifier followed by a colon.  Multiple features
   associated with a single qualifier are separated by the pipe '|' character.
   The content of these lines is described below.
